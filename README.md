# QRding

QRding is a simple self-hosted QR code generator. It includes templates for creating QR codes for sharing WiFi credentials, contact cards, calendar events, links, SMS, phone numbers, email and map locations. In the long-term the goal is to build an automation system around QR codes which allows you to trigger custom actions, track actions or habits and send notifications when a scan event is not triggered.

## About this fork

This is a fork of [rishikanthc/qrding](https://github.com/rishikanthc/qrding). Compared to the original, it adds:

- **A Windows desktop app.** A portable `QRding-x64-portable.exe` (no installer) is built with Tauri and published on every push to `main`: [download the latest build](https://github.com/therealscienta/qrding/releases/download/latest/QRding-x64-portable.exe). It isn't code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen will warn when you run it, and PCs with Smart App Control turned on will block it.
- **More templates.** Link (URL), SMS, phone call, email and map location, on top of the original Wi-Fi, contact card, calendar event and text.
- **Batch mode.** Generate many codes from a CSV file (upload or paste), then export them as a ZIP or print them on one sheet with a chosen code width.
- **More export options.** PNG at 1×–8× tagged 300 DPI for print, vector SVG, and copy to the clipboard. The app confirms each export on screen.
- **A scan check.** Every generated code is read back with a QR decoder before you use it, and batch exports report any rows that fail.
- **Bug fixes.** The color picker no longer closes while you pick a color, a cleared logo no longer lingers, download filenames are no longer garbled, and calendar/vCard escaping is fixed. The preview also fits on phones.
- **Warnings.** The app warns about inverted or low-contrast colors, about low error correction when a logo is used, and when the content is too large for a QR code.
- **Accessibility.** Text contrast meets WCAG AA, and an automated accessibility check runs in CI.
- **A modernized stack.** SvelteKit 2.70, Svelte 5, Vite 8, Tailwind 4 and TypeScript everywhere. The unused Lucia/Drizzle demo code, which broke builds without a database, is removed. There are unit and browser tests, a CI workflow, and a smaller, hardened Docker image (Node 24, running as a non-root user).

## Features

- QR code for sharing WiFi credentials
- QR code for sharing contact cards
- QR code for adding events to calendars
- QR code for links (URL), plain text, SMS, phone calls, email and map locations
- Customize size of QR code image
- Customize color of QR codes
- Embed logo on to QR code
- Adjustable error correction rate
- Download as PNG (1×–8×, tagged 300 DPI for print) or SVG (vector), or copy to the clipboard
- Batch mode: generate many codes from a CSV and download them as a ZIP or print them on one sheet
- Built-in scan check that reads every generated code back before you use it

## Installation

QRding is available as a docker image and can be deployed with the docker-compose provided below. This fork doesn't publish its own image yet: the image below is the original project's, so to run this fork's version, build it locally with `docker build -t qrding .` (or uncomment `build: .` in `docker-compose.yaml`).

```compose
services:
  qrding:
    image: ghcr.io/rishikanthc/qrding:latest
    container_name: qrding
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Cool ideas for using QR codes

I highly recommend getting a label maker to print out QR codes and stick them on specific locations or objects depending on the type of usage.

1. **Connect to WiFi**  
   Encode SSID, security type, and password so scanning immediately joins the network (no manual typing).
1. **Add a Contact (vCard)**  
   Embed a full “virtual business card” (name, phone, email, address). Scanning prompts “Add to Contacts.”
1. **Compose an SMS**  
   Encode SMSTO:+15551234567:Your message here so the user’s messaging app opens with the recipient and body pre-filled.
1. **Dial a Phone Number**  
   Embed an VEVENT (title, start/end, location) so the calendar app offers to add it straight into the user’s schedule.
1. **Send an Email**
   Use MATMSG:TO:you@example.com;SUB:Subject here;BODY:Email body;; or MAILTO: syntax to open the email composer with fields pre-filled.
1. **Geo-Coordinates / Map Location**  
   Encode geo:37.786971,-122.399677 so the mapping app opens at those coordinates.
1. **App Deep-Link or Custom URI Scheme**  
   e.g. myapp://product/1234 launches a specific view inside an installed app (if it supports that URI scheme), or falls back to a URL.
1. **Bluetooth Pairing**  
   Some devices support BLUETOOTH:MAC-address;PIN:1234; → triggers pairing dialogue for headsets or smart devices.
1. **Text-Only Payload**  
   Plain text that the user can copy to clipboard—ideal for coupons, short instructions, or secret messages, without any network call.

# Roadmap for potential advanced use cases

- Save and browse generated QR codes
- Automations via webhooks and integration with other apps like Home Assistant, Ntfy, discord.
  - Track events/habits and trigger notifications - For eg. QR code stuck on medicine cabinet. Scan everytime you take meds. If the code hasn’t been scanned before a pre-set deadline, send a reminder/notification.
  - Trigger specific evens when code is scanned
    - **Smart Home Scene Triggers**: Place QR stickers around the house. Scanning the “Movie Night” code dims lights, closes blinds, and fires up the home theater. Scan “Good Morning” in your bedroom to raise shades, start the coffee maker, and read you the day’s weather.
    - **Equipment & Tool Checkout**: In a makerspace or home workshop, each tool has its own QR. Scanning when you borrow it logs you as the current user. If you haven’t returned (i.e. scanned it back) within your allotted time, an automated reminder pings you.
    - **Plant & Pet Care Scheduling**: QR on each plant’s pot or pet’s food bin: scan to log watering or feeding. If no scan happens after the plant’s ideal watering interval (e.g. 7 days) or pet’s mealtime window, your smart home assistant reminds you.
    - **On-Demand How-To Guides**: Affix QR codes on appliances or furniture. Scanning the code launches the PDF manual.
    - **Vehicle & Machinery Maintenance Logs**: Under the hood or on factory equipment: scan QR to instantly log an oil change, safety inspection, or filter replacement. The system then auto-schedules the next service reminder based on mileage or hours run.
    - **Inventory management**: QR codes on pantry items connect to your home-inventory app. Scanning the last bag of flour or coffee bean container logs the “out-of-stock” event.
